**Interested in computer vision, AI, bioinformatics and HCI|Lecturer, CSE**

I am currently working as a Lecturer at the <a href="https://cse.uiu.ac.bd">Department of CSE, United International University, Bangladesh</a>. My research interests are computer vision, AI, bioinformatics and HCI.

I earned my BSc in EEE from <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)</a> in 2021. Currently, I am pursuing MSc under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2DhrWFgAAAAJ">Dr. Swakkhar Shatabda</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=31mWMiEAAAAJ">Dr. Riasat Azim</a>. Additionally, I am working as a RA at the <a href="https://www.northsouth.edu/">North South University (NSU)</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Izxn2EMAAAAJ">Dr. Nafisa Noor</a> in Large Memristor Crossbar Arrays Analysis and Image Processing.

In my leisure time, i love to play table tennis and binge watch tv series!
