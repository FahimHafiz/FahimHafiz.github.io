### My Role: Treasurer and Robotics Segment Coordinator

I played two significant roles in this large-scale event â€“ Treasurer and Robotics Segment Coordinator. As Treasurer, my responsibilities included managing the budgets for different segments, food arrangements, prize money, and concert organization.  Simultaneously, as the Robotics Segment Coordinator, I played a key role in planning and conducting the robot-related competitions.

### What I Learned

Organizing such a large event taught me a great deal. My skills in time management, teamwork, financial planning, and handling unexpected situations were significantly enhanced.  Furthermore, I had the opportunity to interact with students from all over the country, which enriched my knowledge and experience.
