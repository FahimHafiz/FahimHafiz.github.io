## Excited to share our latest research published in *Biomedical Signal Processing and Control*!

We introduced **FVCM-Net**, a novel deep learning framework designed to tackle one of the most pressing challenges in healthcare: **early and accurate detection of lung cancer**.

### 🔍 Why this matters  
Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection is critical—but building robust, generalizable models is difficult due to **privacy concerns** and **data scarcity** across institutions.

### 💡 What we built  
FVCM-Net combines the strengths of:
- ✅ **VGG16 + CBAM** for attention-guided, explainable lung cancer detection  
- 🔐 **Federated Learning** to preserve patient privacy while enabling collaborative model training across institutions  
- 🧠 **Ensemble Learning** to boost predictive accuracy and robustness  

### 🧪 Key Results
- 📈 Federated + Ensemble learning: **97.37% accuracy**, **97.37% F1-score**  
- 🏆 Ensemble learning alone: **98.26% accuracy**, enhancing clinical decision support  

### 🧬 Interpretability matters  
We integrated **XAI techniques** like **SHAP** and **HiResCAM** to visualize and explain model decisions—empowering radiologists with transparent AI support.

### 📚 Datasets used  
Our model was trained and validated on diverse lung CT scan datasets:
- LIDC-IDRI  
- IQ-OTH/NCCD  
- Kaggle public dataset  
- Additional online sources  

### 🌐 Impact  
FVCM-Net demonstrates how privacy-preserving, explainable AI can revolutionize medical imaging—supporting clinicians with accurate, interpretable insights.
Grateful to my co-authors, mentors, and collaborators who made this possible. Let’s keep pushing the boundaries of AI in healthcare!
