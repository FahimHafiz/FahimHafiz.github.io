## My Experience

As a lecturer in Computer Science and Engineering at UIU, I had the honor of accompanying the team to the United States. The competition was held in Great Lakes Maritime Heritage Center in Alpena, Michigan. We traveled for around 40 hours to reach Chiacgo and then stayed at a motel there. Afterwards, we traveled by road to reach rogers city, Michigan near Alpena. The journey was more than geographical‚Äîit was a leap into global innovation, collaboration, and representation.

From visa preparations to navigating international logistics, every step was a learning curve. I witnessed firsthand the resilience and brilliance of our students as they competed with teams from across the globe, showcasing Bangladeshi talent on an international stage.

My contributions spanned multiple dimensions:

- *Technical Guidance*: I supported the team in the electrical segment, helping refine circuitry.
- *Logistics & Management*: Coordinated travel, documentation, and on-site arrangements to ensure smooth participation.
- *Documentation Excellence*: Assisted in technical report, emphasizing reproducibility, clarity, and innovation.


After the competition, we visited University of Chicago! The university's surrounding environment was inspiring. I, along with my students were amazed at the facilities they have. We hope that such our university back home will someday follow footsteps of top universities like University of Chiacgo.
