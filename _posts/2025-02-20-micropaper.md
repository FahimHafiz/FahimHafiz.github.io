## Paper titled "Design of a Microprocessors and Microcontrollers Laboratory Course Addressing Complex Engineering Problems and Activities" published in Computer Applications in Engineering Education focused on Desigining Novel Curriculum and Education environment

We are thrilled to announce that our first paper in the field of Education, titled "Design of a Microprocessors and Microcontrollers Laboratory Course Addressing Complex Engineering Problems and Activities", has been accepted for publication in the prestigious journal "Computer Applications in Engineering Education" by Wiley. This journal is ranked Q1 in both Engineering and Education categories, with an impact factor of 2.0. 

In this work, we proposed an innovative Laboratory course featuring open-ended labs designed to enable students to solve complex engineering problems and experience complex engineering activities. As we celebrate this milestone, it’s also a reminder that the journey of improvement never stops—it’s time to revisit and enhance the course curriculum once again, technology has evolved that fast! Here’s to continuous learning, innovation, and pushing the boundaries of engineering and HCI to enhance education curriculum!
