## UIU CSE Project Show  

I am thrilled to share that I recently received a crest as one of the main organizers of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uiucseps/">"CSE Project show"</a> from the <a href="https://cse.uiu.ac.bd/faculty/mnh/">"Prof. Dr. Mohammad Nurul Huda"</a>, Head, Dept. of CSE, UIU and <a href="https://cse.uiu.ac.bd/faculty/muzahid/">"Prof. Dr. A.K.M. Muzahidul Islam"</a>, Dept. of CSE, UIU. This recognition is a testament to the hard work and dedication put into making the event a success.

Additionally, the UIU Robotics Club, which played a significant role in the project show, also received crests. Their collaboration and support were crucial in organizing and executing the event successfully. Thanks to UIU Robotics Club President, Mr. Ahmed Junaid Tanim, Ms. Faria Rakib Borsha (GS, UIU Robotics Club), Mr. Rashique Chowdhury (Treasurer, UIU Robotics Club) and others for their significant role. As the moderator of UIU Robotics club, I am proud to have them by our side.
