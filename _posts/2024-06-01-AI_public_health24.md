I had an amazing experience participating in a workshop titled <a href="https://github.com/FahimHafiz/LTspice-integration-with-Matlab-and-Python">"AI in Public Health"</a> organized by Child Health Research Foundation (CHRF), Bangladesh. This five-day workshop focused on exploring the role of AI in public health and how policy should be adopted in recent times. I shall share my learnings in detail in this post later!
