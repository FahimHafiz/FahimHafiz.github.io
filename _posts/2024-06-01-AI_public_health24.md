I had an amazing experience participating in a workshop titled <a href="https://chrfbd.org/blogs/474f2f3e-7c9e-402f-9ed6-c17cec81a7d9">"AI in Public Health"</a> organized by Child Health Research Foundation (CHRF), Bangladesh. This five-day workshop focused on exploring the role of AI in public health and how policy should be adopted in recent times. This five days workshop was taken by three esteemed researchers in their respective area:
 -Senjuti Saha, PhD, Deputy Executive Director, Child Health Research Foundation (CHRF)
 -Yogesh Hooda, PhD, Lead, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Laboratory
 -Sudipta Saha, PhD student, Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Hardvard University

In this workshop, basics of data visualization of vaccination datasets, data cleaning and analyzing using python and prediction on dengue datasets (time series) using machine learning was taught. Furthermore, deep learning aspects was also discussed. Moreover, how disease modelling is performed along with health policy and recent trends of AI as well as it's ethical perspective was discussed.

Here is a session on utilizing AI in Public health by Mr. Sudipta Saha..

I intend to write the more technical learnings from this workshop in a series of lectures, specially the Machine Learning examples. Please keep an eye on my GitHub profile. Here is already the first series of my learning from this workshop: <a href="https://github.com/FahimHafiz/Vaccination-Dataset-Preprocessing-Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning">"Vaccination Dataset Preprocessing Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning"</a>
