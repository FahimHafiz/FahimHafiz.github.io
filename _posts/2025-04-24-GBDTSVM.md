## GBDTSVM: Combined Support Vector Machine and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree Framework for efficient snoRNA-disease association prediction

Excited to share our latest research published in Computers in Biology and Medicine (Q1)! 

Our paper introduces GBDTSVM, a novel machine learning framework that efficiently predicts snoRNA-disease associations by integrating Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). With superior performance on multiple datasets, this model offers a powerful tool for advancing snoRNA-related disease research.
