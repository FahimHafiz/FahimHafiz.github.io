This is the first time a team from Bangladesh has participated and won at this prestigious underwater robotics competition.”</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2> <p>As a lecturer in Computer Science and Engineering at UIU, I had the honor of accompanying the team to the United States. The competition was held in Great Lakes Maritime Heritage Center in Alpena, Michigan. We traveled for around 40 hours to reach Chiacgo and then stayed at a motel there. Afterwards, we traveled by road to reach rogers city, Michigan near Alpena. The journey was more than geographical—it was a leap into global innovation, collaboration, and representation.</p> <p>From visa preparations to navigating international logistics, every step was a learning curve. I witnessed firsthand the resilience and brilliance of our students as they competed with teams from across the globe, showcasing Bangladeshi talent on an international stage.</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/FahimHafiz/FahimHafiz.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/MARINER_2.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Figure 2.

In this study, we propose a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability of rapid diagnostic test result interpretation by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), within a smartphone-based application. The app enables users to take pictures of their test kits, which YOLOv8 then processes to precisely crop and extract the membrane region, even if the test kit is not centered in the frame or is positioned at the very edge of the image. This capability offers greater accessibility, allowing even visually impaired individuals to capture test images without needing perfect alignment, thus promoting user independence and inclusivity. The extracted image is analyzed by an additional CNN classifier that determines if the results are positive, negative, or invalid, providing users with the results and a confidence level. Through validation experiments with commonly used rapid test kits across various diagnostic applications, our results demonstrate that the synergistic integration of AI significantly improves sensitivity and specificity in test result interpretation. This improvement can be attributed to the extraction of the membrane zones from the test kit images using the state-of-the-art YOLO algorithm. Additionally, we performed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to investigate the factors influencing the model’s decisions, identifying reasons behind both correct and incorrect classifications. By facilitating the differentiation of genuine test lines from background noise and providing valuable insights into test line intensity and uniformity, our approach offers a robust solution to challenges in rapid test interpretation.</p> <p>Check out the paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18007">“archived version”</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper on Rapid Kit Test results prediction from smartphone is arXived!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Checkout my latest work: Circuit Simulator Automation using Python and MATLAB</title><link href="https://fahimhafiz.github.io/https:/github.com/FahimHafiz/LTspice-integration-with-Matlab-and-Python" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Checkout my latest work: Circuit Simulator Automation using Python and MATLAB"/><published>2024-10-24T00:32:13+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-24T00:32:13+00:00</updated><id>https://fahimhafiz.github.io/https:/github.com/FahimHafiz/circuit_automation24</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://fahimhafiz.github.io/https:/github.com/FahimHafiz/LTspice-integration-with-Matlab-and-Python"><![CDATA[<p>Checkout my latest work <a href="https://github.com/FahimHafiz/LTspice-integration-with-Matlab-and-Python">“Circuit Simulator Automation using Python and MATLAB”</a> which makes the circuit analysis easier and more interesting!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Checkout my latest work: Circuit Simulator Automation using Python and MATLAB, which makes the circuit analysis easier and more interesting!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Glad to be organising another project show at UIU!</title><link href="https://fahimhafiz.github.io/https:/www.facebook.com/uiucseps/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Glad to be organising another project show at UIU!"/><published>2024-10-07T00:32:13+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-07T00:32:13+00:00</updated><id>https://fahimhafiz.github.io/https:/www.facebook.com/CSE_project_show24</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://fahimhafiz.github.io/https:/www.facebook.com/uiucseps/"><![CDATA[<p>Hectic yet had an amazing experience while organising the project show, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uiucseps/">“Project show, UIU”</a>.

This five-day workshop focused on exploring the role of AI in public health and how policy should be adopted in recent times. This five days workshop was taken by three esteemed researchers in their respective area: -Senjuti Saha, PhD, Deputy Executive Director, Child Health Research Foundation (CHRF) -Yogesh Hooda, PhD, Lead, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Laboratory -Sudipta Saha, PhD student, Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Hardvard University</p> <p>In this workshop, basics of data visualization of vaccination datasets, data cleaning and analyzing using python and prediction on dengue datasets (time series) using machine learning was taught. Furthermore, deep learning aspects was also discussed. Moreover, how disease modelling is performed along with health policy and recent trends of AI as well as it’s ethical perspective was discussed.</p> <p>Here is a session on utilizing AI in Public health by Mr. Sudipta Saha.. <img src="https://github.com/FahimHafiz/FahimHafiz.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/chrf24_1.jpeg?raw=true" alt="AI in Public Health Session taken by Mr. Sudipta Saha" width="900"/> <br/></p> <figcaption style="text-align: center;">AI in Public Health Session taken by Mr. Sudipta Saha!</figcaption> <p>Here are some moments from this wonderful workshop!</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/FahimHafiz/FahimHafiz.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/chrf24_3.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Memorable moments with the friends/participants from this workshop where we met for the first time!" width="900"/> <br/></p> <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Memorable moments with the friends/participants from this workshop where we met for the first time!</figcaption> <p><img src="https://github.com/FahimHafiz/FahimHafiz.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/chrf24_4.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Receiving the workshop certificate from Dr. Senjuti Saha and Dr. Yogesh Hooda!" width="900"/> <br/></p> <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Receiving the workshop certificate from Dr. Senjuti Saha and Dr. Yogesh Hooda!</figcaption> <p>Here is the group photo with the amazing CHRF team on the last day of our workshop! <img src="https://github.com/FahimHafiz/FahimHafiz.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/chrf24_2.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Group photo with the amazing CHRF team" width="900"/> <br/></p> <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Group photo with the amazing CHRF team</figcaption> <p>I intend to write the more technical learnings from this workshop in a series of lectures, specially the Machine Learning examples.
